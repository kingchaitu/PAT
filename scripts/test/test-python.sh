# The CAD Viewer backend keeps its tests beside the package it covers rather
# than under tests/, so name the directory explicitly. It owns the only cross-process
# coverage of the generation lock (test_artifact.py drives a real second process and
# SIGKILLs it), which is why it must run in CI.
# packages/cadgen/src is on the path because the viewer server imports cadgen's
# stdlib-only modules directly (coordination, source_hash) rather than reimplementing
# them. Without it an installed/editable cadgen from another checkout wins and the
# coordination package is missing.
